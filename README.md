cs 465-Full Stack Development MEAN Stack


summer start comparing the different types of front end development that I could use for a full step project they all bring a variety of cards to the table to put into play HTML is more hard coded in JavaScript makes it very flexible and the single page application makes it easier to swap in and out different data types as well as authentication. When we're looking at a small business using no SQL mongo DB database it's the cheapest and most affordable as in it does handle most of what SQL normally would handle without the big price tag attached to it.

Json and JavaScript are like night and day JavaScript will execute programs and certain commands whereas json can tie the front and the back end pieces together quite nicely as it is a mix between an HTML format and JavaScript at the same time it does provide a nice refactor code and it does improve functionality and efficiency with various reusable user interface UI components that could be easily swapped out four different projects you may have down the road

but during this course we are not fully done a lot of different testing methods on our websites but we have done enough to test various endpoints of API testing in addition to the difficulties of testing and adding layers for example a registry button a sign in button and the login page can be considered a multiple secured endpoint for a full stack development.
overall this course has given me a better understanding on where I'm going to take my computer science career and if what I was originally looking at as full stack is was something I want to pursue still. Well I can't say for certain that it is but it has led to other various opportunities for me to better myself and understanding of full stack I think in the long run I will still stick with the full stack but maybe do some of these newer upcoming development projects like blockchain development which does have a lot of basis on a full stack development guide but branches off into the crypto world I can see down the road that there will be more opportunities like this and I will make sure to jump on them ahead of time
